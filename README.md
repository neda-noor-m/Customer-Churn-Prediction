# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This notebook focuses on predicting whether a customer will switch to a different telecommunications provider, a phenomenon known as "churn."
Steps in this notebook:
Data analysis: We begin by analyzing the data to uncover hidden patterns and gain meaningful insights.
Bivariate analysis and outlier detection: Using bivariate analysis and box plots, we identify outliers and mitigate their negative effects.
Feature engineering: We perform feature engineering, creating a new feature that plays a crucial role in improving the model's performance.
Machine learning models: We apply several machine learning algorithms to the data, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97.6%.
